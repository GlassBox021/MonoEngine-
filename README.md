MonoEngine++: A 3D Game Engine In C++

Currently learning C++ at the moment, but already planned on making this engine. I know a tiny bit of C++ and a bit of other stuff though, but have not tried to make a engine from scratch. So i'm gonna try to develop this engine.

And yes i will make this engine open source, That's why it's on github.

Have fun!
